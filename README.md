# COSC 469 Anti-Phishin Browsin-Extension (APeBEhavior)

We are trying to stop people from getting phished using ape methods.

## Requirements

We suggest having nvm and npm installed. We use node 20 so do command `nvm use 20`. If it is not installed then do `nvm install 20` then rerun the previous command.

In the root dir of the project run `npm install` to install all the node modules.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project.

## Load into browser

To load the extension into the chrome browser go to the extensions page of the browser. In the top right turn on Developer Mode. In the top left select load unpacked. Select the dist folder that was generated in the root directory.

## Api

The api is currently live at https://phish.gannaway.co. It will be up until January 2025.
